# accord

Accord is discord for iOS improvement software. It offers useful features, and it allows a level of customisation not possible before.

## Types of releases:

You can find releases [here](https://github.com/accordtweak/accord/releases)
We will offer two types of releases:

### Stable:

These are the binaries located in master. They are usually more stable than those located in Canary.

### Canary:

These releases are often compiled with the discord for iOS testflight, and offer bleeding edge accord features, with a sacrifice of stableness. **They are prone to crash, but don't let that put you off!**
